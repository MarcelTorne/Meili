# Summary for sprint 9

This week, I worked on the poi detection user story. I first used google's Landmark Detection API which took much less time than what I had predicted. Turned out that the API did all of the work and all I needed to do was call the API and handle the response.

However, this API only works for well known landmarks like the EIffel tower and not for something more day-to-day like the EPFL Rolex. I decided to improve poi detection using my own implementation and estimated it would take around 6h, which was the time I had remaning in the sprint. To this end, I used the accelerometer and magnetic field sensors to calculate the orientation of a user's phone. This allowed me to find which POI was nearest in the user's field of view. This now allows the user to see what POI they are looking at just by orienting their phone towards it! This feature took me 7h instead of my 6h estimation because I had to learn more about the different layouts in android.

I combined these 2 features and added them to the main map actiivty so that the user has fast access to poi detection, allowing them to quickly find out the name (and maybe details in the future!) of the POI they are looking at.
