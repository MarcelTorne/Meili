# Summary for sprint 11

## Ahmed

This week I finshed writing the tests for the notifcations code. The test themsleves aren't long but I had to rewrite a lot of code and spend a lot of time to figure out how to make the code "testable"
I also added the feature where the date of a chat message is only shown if it's a new day.

I am very glad my time estimates this week were very correct. 

## Aman


## Ewan 
 

## Marcel 


## Thomas (Scrum Master)

This week I worked on making a multitude of small improvements and bug fixes for the app.

I am happy that I managed to merge all of my tasks, except for one. The app now has a better feel, look, and is more coherent overall.

I was not able to merge my last task because once again I has problems with all of the tests passing locally, but not on cirrus. I didn't have enough time to find the root of the issue.


## Yingxuan


## Overall team

This week, the team did a lot of polishing work so that Meili looks like a legit app which could be on the app store! This includes convenience features such as a dark mode, interface ameliorations, bug fixes, and user experience improvements to make navigation in the app flow more smoothly.

This week had a lot of pull requests, so team members collaborated a lot in reviewing each others' code. Many changes made this week were subjective, so team members were also helpful in giving their opinions so that we have an app that everyone is happy with.
