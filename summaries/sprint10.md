# Summary for sprint 10

I implemented a feed where the user can see posts from points of interests around them. I started out by upgrading our firstore databse service to support queries and adapted its usage accordingly. For the feed itself, I used a couple of our previously-built services like the poi fetcher and the forum activity. This led me to refactor a lot of code to avoid duplication, improve the maintainibility of the codebase and allow for even easier additions in the future. For this user story, I had a perfect time estimate overall even though a couple of my tasks took one hour more and less, compensating each other.

It was a lot of fun working on this feature and it's great that we can now implement such complex-looking features with ease thanks to the general services we implemented in earlier sprints.
