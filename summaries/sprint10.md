# Summary for sprint 10

I implemented a feed where the user can see posts from points of interests around them. I started out by upgrading our firstore databse service to support queries and adapted its usage accordingly. For the feed itself, I used a couple of our previously-built services like the poi fetcher and the forum activity. This led me to refactor a lot of code to avoid duplication, improve the maintainibility of the codebase and allow for even easier additions in the future. For this user story, I had a perfect time estimate overall even though a couple of my tasks took one hour more and less, compensating each other.

It was a lot of fun working on this feature and it's great that we can now implement such complex-looking features with ease thanks to the general services we implemented in earlier sprints.

During this sprint, I implemented two big features. The first was to improve the point of interest information screen, and add it to the application flow. This meant that I had to link it from the map activity to information screen, and this information screen to the chats, forum and reviews. Moreover, I implemented a couple of small features inside this screen as the possibility to call the poi, give you directions to the poi (by directing you to google maps) and show you a quick preview of the website (three features that I find really cool).  I am happy since this task took me as expected 4 hours of work.
The second task I had to do was to change in the whole application, to have the possibilitiy to access the author profile. So for example, in reviews, we wanted to display the image of the author and name (which were not yet available in the activity) and then add the possibility of redirecting you to their profile. I estimated 2 hours of workload, but now I see that it was really underestimated. It took me over 5 hours to finish this feature. One of the causes where that some PRs with big modifications of the files I was working on where merged while I was working on the feature, and then it took me a long time to merge my part with the changes.

Despite this last task taking me more than expected, I am really happy with the work I've done this week since it is finishing to polish the app and making it look like a real app that you could find in google play store.
