# Summary for sprint 4

I continued working on the POI review feature this sprint. I was able to finish its implementation, retouch the UI, and merge the feature into main with high coverage.

My time estimate for this week was correct as I am starting to have a good idea of how much time testing a certain feature can take.

After finishing all tasks assigned to me for this sprint, I looked into my task for the next sprint: implementing a cache for our Firestore databases. I found out that Firestore already implements a caching mechanism in the background. Since we have a small minority of features (currently only 1, namely the POIService, but this might increase in the future) which use other APIs, with the team I decided to assign this task a lower priority and moved it back to the product backlog.
