This week I finished and tested my features for the photo editor. I ran into quite a few problems and got stuck, but I managed to fix everything. These features are rotating the image, cropping the image and adding emojis to it. I am proud in particular of having found how to test the rotationGestureDetector, which saved a lot of coverage issues I was afraid I wouldn't be able to test.

My time estimates this week were quite good except for the the time I spent being stuck on problems. I spent 14h of my time this week, I'm still very slow at writing code, but at least I finally managed to implement my tasks.

This week I finished the filters feature and I improved the photo editing UI. I also added the possibility to switch between the front and back camera in the camera activity.

Compared to last week, I was able to merge all the features that I has planned this week. I was less greedy and better in my time estimates.

Next week, I want to improve the speed at which I write code, because sometimes I go in wrong directions when trying to implement a feature, which makes me lose time. So I have to plan better and be better at sensing when the way that I am trying to implement a feature is not the right one.
