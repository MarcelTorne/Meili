This week I finished and tested my features for the photo editor. I ran into quite a few problems and got stuck, but I managed to fix everything. These features are rotating the image, cropping the image and adding emojis to it. I am proud in particular of having found how to test the rotationGestureDetector, which saved a lot of coverage issues I was afraid I wouldn't be able to test.

My time estimates this week were quite good except for the the time I spent being stuck on problems. I spent 14h of my time this week, I'm still very slow at writing code, but at least I finally managed to implement my tasks.
