This week I finished and tested my features for the photo editor. I ran into quite a few problems and got stuck, but I managed to fix everything. These features are rotating the image, cropping the image and adding emojis to it. I am proud in particular of having found how to test the rotationGestureDetector, which saved a lot of coverage issues I was afraid I wouldn't be able to test.

My time estimates this week were quite good except for the the time I spent being stuck on problems. I spent 14h of my time this week, I'm still very slow at writing code, but at least I finally managed to implement my tasks.

I started this week by implementing the error handling when receiving a response from an API. I made a first version which was to keep calling the API every 5 minutes but after discussing with Aman we decided the best would be to make a couple of requests and if errors keep persisting then we don't expect that this error will be solved before closing the app and we stop requesting a response (for eg server might be down, or no internet connection). My second task was to refactor the cache service to make it general and usable bu more activities other than the POIService. Finally, I spent 1 hour more on the second cache than expected and since Aman had already finished his tasks for the week we decided that he was going to take my third task and I instead did an extra smaller task of adding the login activity popup on the profile activity if the user is not logged in.

My time estimates are getting much better, for the first and third tasks my estimates were accurate. And, for the second one I was just slightly off by 1 hour, I predicted 4 hours but spent 5 on the second task.

For the weeks to come I will be looking for finishing to improve my time estimations and improving my productivity in terms of useful code per sprint.

## Thomas

This week I finished the filters feature and I improved the photo editing UI. I also added the possibility to switch between the front and back camera in the camera activity.

Compared to last week, I was able to merge all the features that I has planned this week. I was less greedy and better in my time estimates.

Next week, I want to improve the speed at which I write code, because sometimes I go in wrong directions when trying to implement a feature, which makes me lose time. So I have to plan better and be better at sensing when the way that I am trying to implement a feature is not the right one.
