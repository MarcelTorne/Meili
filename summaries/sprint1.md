# Summary for sprint 1

## Ahmed

I implemented the chat view activity where you can send and receive messages in a very protoypical way.

My feature is still not complete I have to make sure the chatting logic is correct and I need to refactor
the code to comply with the mvcc model.

My time estimation was way off since I had a lot of problems with api_keys and secrets along with version control problems
and writing tests

Next time, I'll be more prepared for the surprises of github and I'll make sure to have more realistic time estimates.



## Aman (Scrum master)

I collaborated on the map feature and its testing. I also reconfigured the repository as we switched from a personal an organizational one.

My time estimate was heavily underestimated as I didn't factor in the overhead of learning about the various testing frameworks and handling keys with Cirrus CI.

Next time, I will try to plan my tasks with more granularity to have a better estimate and to better organize myself.


## Ewan

I worked on the forum and post creation feature.

My time estimate was of 8h, and I spent 15h from start to finish. 
Breakdown : 3h choosing a database (Cloud Firestore) and learning how it works, 5h Making the UI dynamically, 3h on making the post clickable & read/write to database, 4h on testing asynchronous operations and debugging.

The tests and the conflict resolutions passed on my machine on thursday night, but when I made the Pull Request, it failed.

I will need to greatly reevaluate my time estimates, as it blew them away.


## Marcel

I worked on the google sign in button. I also collaborated in the switching from a personal repository to organizational.

My estimate was underestimated, my estimate was of 8 hours and I went well over 13 hours. This extra time was due to some problems with the API keys, learning how to properly implement the MVVC pattern on android and learning UI testing.

On the upside, I have learned a lot this week, mostly in testing and how to implement MVVC. I think this will be of great use for the upcoming weeks and will allow me to provide better code faster.


## Thomas

I implemented the map activity for the app, which also shows nearby points of interest.

Implementing the map went faster than I thought as the google maps api already does a lot of the work.

Overall, I underestimated the time it would take as testing the map took a lot more time due to having to learn UI testing. Test coverage is only up to about 50% for now so wasn't able to merge to main branch.


## Yingxuan

I worked on the user profile, I did not manage to have a functional profile which is able to store the data of user on firebase, the program exit too early, so I shouldd still write tests and find out the reason. The positive side is we can still see the UI design of the profile and modify locally the data. 

The time needed was underestimated, I spent over 12h, extra time mostly spending on learning data binding, how firebase works, comparing different ways to implement the profile, I also spent a lot of time to debug, I had extra errors with the old version of Android Studio.

Next time I will try to make a better use of my time.
