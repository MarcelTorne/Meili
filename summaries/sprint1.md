# Summary for sprint 1

## Aman (Scrum master)

I worked on the testing of the map feature. I also reconfigured the repository as we switched from a personal repository to an organizational repository.

My time estimate was underestimated, mainly due to the overhead of learning about the various testing frameworks.

Next time, I will try to plan my tasks with more granularity to have a better estimate and to better organize myself.

## Ewan

I worked on the forum and post creation feature.

My time estimate was of 8h, and I spent 15h from start to finish. 
Breakdown : 3h choosing a database (Cloud Firestore) and learning how it works, 5h Making the UI dynamically, 3h on making the post clickable & read/write to database, 4h on testing asynchronous operations and debugging.

I will need to greatly reevaluate my time estimates, as it blew them away.
