# Summary for sprint 1

## Aman (Scrum master)

I worked on the testing of the map feature. I also reconfigured the repository as we switched from a personal repository to an organizational repository.

My time estimate was underestimated, mainly due to the overhead of learning about the various testing frameworks.

Next time, I will try to plan my tasks with more granularity to have a better estimate and to better organize myself.

## Ewan

I worked on the forum and post creation feature.

My time estimate was of 8h, and I spent 15h from start to finish. 
Breakdown : 3h choosing a database (Cloud Firestore) and learning how it works, 5h Making the UI dynamically, 3h on making the post clickable & read/write to database, 4h on testing asynchronous operations and debugging.

I will need to greatly reevaluate my time estimates, as it blew them away.


## Marcel

I worked on the google sign in button. I also collaborated in the switching from a personal repository to organizational.

My estimate was underestimated, my estimate was of 8 hours and I went well over 13 hours. This extra time was due to some problems with the API keys, learning how to properly implement the MVVC pattern on android and learning UI testing.

On the upside, I have learned a lot this week, mostly in testing and how to implement MVVC. I think this will be of great use for the upcoming weeks and will allow me to provide better code faster.


## Thomas

I implemented the map activity for the app, which also shows nearby points of interest.

Implementing the map went faster than I thought as the google maps api already does a lot of the work.

Overall, I underestimated the time it would take as testing the map took a lot more time due to having to learn UI testing. Test coverage is only up to about 50% for now so wasn't able to merge to main branch.
