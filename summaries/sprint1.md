# Summary for sprint 1

## Aman (Scrum master)

I worked on the testing of the map feature. I also reconfigured the repository as we switched from a personal repository to an organizational repository.

My time estimate was underestimated, mainly due to the overhead of learning about the various testing frameworks.

Next time, I will try to plan my tasks with more granularity to have a better estimate and to better organize myself.
