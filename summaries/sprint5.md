# Summary for sprint 5

This week I worked on cropping photos, resizing and rotating the photos. I'm not quite done with the feature, because Android does not provide a way to get an angle from a two finger rotating motion. I am still figuring out how to implement this. The cropping functionality and the function to rotate from a given angle are done, but not yet tested.

I also helped Thomas to figure out how to make cirrus work for the camera tests, as they only passed locally. This feature was merged successfully.

I'm not quite sure what counts for last week or this week, but I finished the forum by implementing the last PR nitpicks during the holidays. I also made the presentation video for the mid semester demo.

As we weren't sure what tools to use and what to implement for the photo editing, it took me some extra time to figure out what libraries to use, so my time estimates are off quite a bit. I should also account for testing more in my future time estimates.

This week, I worked on implementing drawing with the finger on top of pictures which have been taken. With Aman's tips, I was also able to use mockito to test the poi info activity and achieve high coverage. I also managed to figure out how to run tests which use the camera on cirrus so I was able to merge the photo branch as well.

I am happy with what I have achieved for the drawing feature, as I managed to implement what I has envisioned without making any concessions because of technical obstacles. Also, I arrived a bit early at each stand up meeting this week.

I didn't manage to totally finish what I has planned to do, as I still need to implement the color picker for the drawing feature, and to test the activity. But I have caught up on branches which I hadn't managed to merge, so now I will be able to focus more on my work.

## Overall team

During this two week long sprint, the team has implemented many new features, including a camera and photo editing, using a whole new API for points of interest, storing and retrieving information from Firebase, and additional features for the forum. Most of the app's core features are nearly done being implemented, and further sprints will start focusing more on incorporating everything together and polishing certain parts of the app.

Team members are keen to help each other, by clarifying how their code functions or by explaining aspects of Android development which they have well understood. Collaboration is also apparent in the apparition of reusable pieces of code, with general interfaces having been developed to model databases and interact with Firebase.

For next week, the team still needs to work a bit on honing their time estimation skills for feature implementation, as certain tasks are left unfinished and others have been added mid-sprint.
