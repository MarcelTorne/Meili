# Summary for sprint 3

## Ahmed

I worked solely on tests this week. I have worked on creating tests for the forum branch using mocks to have the maximum possible code coverage. I have also worked on increasing the coverage of the already found tests in the chat branch. I also introduced some bug fixes to some tests in the codebase.

After two weeks, my estimates are finally accurate. I am starting to have a sense of how much a test for a certain code would take.

Similarly to me learning advanced vcs features, I feel like making tests and mocking services is something that would take up most of the time in one week but would be faster to do in later weeks since I would have learned the basics on how to do these things.


## Aman 

I worked on the Point of Interest review system (with Firebase) this week and finished it's implementation. This allows the user to add reviews (or edit their review if they already added one), see others' reviews and the average rating for a POI. However, I haven't been able to implement tests for this feature, which is why it couldn't be merged.

My time estimates were very underestimated. I had estimated 8 hours to finish this feature. However, I spent 16 hours on it this week just to finish the implementation and another 2 hours or so trying to learn about mocking and related concepts like argument capturing.

The reason behind my understimation was the fact that I didn't know the complexity of learning about and implementing a MVVM architecture and Firebase. I will continue improving my estimations by attributing more time to learning about new frameworks/apis/architectures and testing in the future.


## Ewan

#TODO


## Marcel (Scrum Master)

I worked on finishing the chat, we use to have a one-to-one chat and now we have a group chat linked to a specific point of interest. I also worked on improving the UI for the chats, and now it feels closer to a real commercial messaging app. Finally, I also collaborated with Ahmed on improving the previous tests that were failing on CirrusCI.

This week I managed to finish all of the tasks that were assigned to me at the beginning of the sprint and also took an extra task (fixing the tests that were sometimes failing on CirrusCI). 

My time estimates were still a little bit off by underestimating but I am getting closer. On the bad side, I wanted to help Ewan to finish the tests for the forum but didn't manage to find time for that due to the workload in other courses. I hope to be able to help more in the next sprints.

## Overall team

The team has worked hard and collaborated to improve testing. We can say that we are using Mockito extensively and in the following weeks will keep bringing it to the rest of the codebase. 

#TODO
We haven't managed to finish all of the user stories we have assigned this sprint. Therefore, we will have the same user stories since we believe these are the most important ones.

Even though our time estimates this week were a bit better, we are still learning to account for various sub-tasks such as reading the documentation, testing, merging, etc. One thing we should improve is having more meetings among team members when we are stuck. This will help us avoid wasting time on bugs/problems which we cannot solve on our own and make forward progress.

The standup meeting really helped this time especially since every person has gained some experience in an API, we usually found ourselves saying "hey I something like that before, maybe I can show you how to do it after the meeting" and we found that to be really beneficial.
