# Summary for sprint 6

I refactored it to use a recycler view which is more efficient and to use the general database to remove redundant code. I also integrated the gallery and the camera features with the forum, allowing users to add photos to their posts.

I finished all my tasks for this sprint and took on an extra 4 hour task since I had more free time from other courses this week. My time estimates were almost on point with a couple of tasks that I over/under estimated by 1 hour. Finally, I helped Ahmed clean up the tests in the unified UI pull request.

Overall, I am happy with my work this week as I am becoming more efficient. This is mainly because I'm learning to better dig throug documentation and testing is becoming less of hurdle since I understand mocking.

This week, I first worked on integrating the changes Marcel made to the map with my poi info activiy, so that I can merge it. Then, I continued working on the photo editing. I added color picking for drawing on the image, and (since I had more time) the option to add filters to the image. I also added undo and redo buttons.

Overall, adding the color picker was faster than I thought, so I had more time to implement the filters additionally.

However, filters took more time to implement than I thought. So I did not have time to polish the activity to merge it. Next week, I have to be less greedy and first focus on my assigned task, merge it, and then think about doing something else.
