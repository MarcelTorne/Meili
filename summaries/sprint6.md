# Summary for sprint 6

I refactored it to use a recycler view which is more efficient and to use the general database to remove redundant code. I also integrated the gallery and the camera features with the forum, allowing users to add photos to their posts.

I finished all my tasks for this sprint and took on an extra 4 hour task since I had more free time from other courses this week. My time estimates were almost on point with a couple of tasks that I over/under estimated by 1 hour. Finally, I helped Ahmed clean up the tests in the unified UI pull request.

Overall, I am happy with my work this week as I am becoming more efficient. This is mainly because I'm learning to better dig throug documentation and testing is becoming less of hurdle since I understand mocking.
