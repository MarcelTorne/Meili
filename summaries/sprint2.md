I worked on improving the sing in tests since I was using Firebase and this was making the tests sometimes fail on Cirrus. Moreover, I have implemented the database classes for chat groups and the view model for the chat group activity.

My estimate was underestimated for the sign in testing and refactoring, my estimate was of 2 hours and I went over 4 hours. This was again because I had to learn and find how to modularize and refactor those classes. Something I have to improve regarding the chat groups is that when creating the tasks for the sprint I didn't account for many previous task that had to be done (e.g. Database Service) before actually being able to properly implement the chat groups.

On the positive side, I believe I found a balance in with my first two PRs this week, which were of appropriate length to be happily revised by my peers.
