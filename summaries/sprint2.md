# Summary for sprint 2

I worked on finishing the map activity and its test. I also learned about Firebase in order to implement a POI database but, after talking to my teams, we realized that it is not needed. With my freed-up time, I started implementing a review system. For this, I have learned about the MVVM pattern and the RecyclerView. Since I still need to connect the review system to the Firebase database, I will not be able to merge this feature in time for this week's demo.

My time estimates were better than last week as I factored in the learning time.

In the future, I will try to define tasks which are clearly separate from my colleagues to reduce the chances of wasting my time on overlapping tasks.

I worked on improving the sing in tests since I was using Firebase and this was making the tests sometimes fail on Cirrus. Moreover, I have implemented the database classes for chat groups and the view model for the chat group activity.

My estimate was underestimated for the sign in testing and refactoring, my estimate was of 2 hours and I went over 4 hours. This was again because I had to learn and find how to modularize and refactor those classes. Something I have to improve regarding the chat groups is that when creating the tasks for the sprint I didn't account for many previous task that had to be done (e.g. Database Service) before actually being able to properly implement the chat groups.

On the positive side, I believe I found a balance in with my first two PRs this week, which were of appropriate length to be happily revised by my peers.
