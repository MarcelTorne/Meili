## Ewan 
This week I implemented the comments feature. I managed to write the tests and also refactored all RecyclerAdapters and abstracting the duplications inside an interface.
I'm very happy with how I worked this week, I did not get stuck and my time estimate was perfect (took me 8h in total). Hopefully it continues like this.

The branch will be merged once the upvote/downvote will be merged, as my branch was built on top of that.


## Marcel 

This week I implemented two features. The first was to create a personalised list of friends. This task was successfully coded in the estimated time (3 hours). The second task was to implement an individual chat with friends. This task has also been successfully implemented in the estimated time (6 hours). Actually, I could reuse most of the code for the chat (as I expected) and this is the reason why a non-trivial task like creating a chat has been done so quicly.

I am really happy with the codebase we are building and maintaining since it allows reusability and to quickly implement new variants of complex features.
