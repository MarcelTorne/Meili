# Summary for sprint 7

## Ahmed (Scrum Master)

This week I finished up the upvote/downvote feature with the help of Aman to do more tests (and increase coverage). As soon as I was finished, I worked on the dark theme mode and also finished this feature. Unfortuately, I didn't have enough time to finish my last feature of the week which was the Facebook login option. I'll have to continue working on it next week.

The time estimations were off this time. But since I had three tasks to implement, I was still able to merge 2/3 features and I will simply continue on the final feature next week along with another feature. So I feel like this failed time estimation didn't do a lot of damage.

In the future, I hope I make better time estimates and have a smoother workflow in collaborative sprint tasks.

## Aman

This week I worked on a tabular UI for the application to make the application more attactive. It was fun to work on the UI for a change as I got to learn new things and make UI choices. My time estimate for this feature was more or less accurate. During its implementation, I realized that it would be a good idea to add the ability to sign out in the profile too and went ahead and implemented that, which took me another 2h.

With the remaining 2h I had, I helped Ahmed to finish the upvote/downvote feature by testing the Firebase transaction service. Since I already spent 8h on SDP this week, I didn't end up starting the second task I had planned for this sprint.

I'm happy with my work this week as I was manage my time well and be productive despite a heavy workload in other courses.


## Ewan 
This week I implemented the comments feature. I managed to write the tests and also refactored all RecyclerAdapters and abstracting the duplications inside an interface.
I'm very happy with how I worked this week, I did not get stuck and my time estimate was perfect (took me 8h in total). Hopefully it continues like this.

The branch will be merged once the upvote/downvote will be merged, as my branch was built on top of that.


## Marcel 

This week I implemented two features. The first was to create a personalised list of friends. This task was successfully coded in the estimated time (3 hours). The second task was to implement an individual chat with friends. This task has also been successfully implemented in the estimated time (6 hours). Actually, I could reuse most of the code for the chat (as I expected) and this is the reason why a non-trivial task like creating a chat has been done so quicly.

I am really happy with the codebase we are building and maintaining since it allows reusability and to quickly implement new variants of complex features.


## Thomas

This week I worked on implementing the poi history feature for the profile.

I am happy because it looks quite good and I managed to make it in the right amount of time.

However I fell sick so wasn't able to finish testing it and to work on the other tasks for this week. So next week I will have some catching up to do.


## Yingxuan

This week I worked on filtering posts of forum by time. Since we do not have a lot of posts for each POIs yet, it makes more sense to do a sorting instead of a filter. So this feature enables user to sort posts from most recent to least recent or the inverse way. At the beginning I wanted to use the query class existing in android library, but it seems not to be compatible with our database, so I added timestamp on post and did a comparator myself. I also set up the dropdown button so that in the future we can add other filtering or sorting options in a more organized way.

The positive side is that I improved in time estimation and spent the amount of time that I planed to finish the task. Next time I want to be more efficient with code climate, because I wasted time on trying to improve on cognitive complexity that it pointed out.


## Overall team

This week, the team has felt confident that the core features of the app are done. Therefore, we decided to add new extensions to these already existing features (such as filtering posts, personalized friend lists, upvote/downvote + comments on posts, nicer general UI).

People who finish early their tasks got the habbit of helping their colleagues who are in need (especially in tasks they are experienced with).

The stand-up meetings prevail to be more useful day by day. Since with these feature extensions, more creative decisions have to be made and having the entire team aware of these decisions to be made is very useful.
