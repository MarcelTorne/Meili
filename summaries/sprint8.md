This week I implemented the comments feature. I managed to write the tests and also refactored all RecyclerAdapters and abstracting the duplications inside an interface.
I'm very happy with how I worked this week, I did not get stuck and my time estimate was perfect (took me 8h in total). Hopefully it continues like this.

The branch will be merged once the upvote/downvote will be merged, as my branch was built on top of that.
